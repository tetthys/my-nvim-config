I was strongly influenced by [this course by typecraft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHTeCSVAFNY&list=PLsz00TDipIffreIaUNk64KxTIkQaGguqn). If you feel like you've forgotten something, check out this course again. It's a great foundation.

# MUST-HAVE SOFTWARES TO DEVELOPE WITH NEOVIM

# How to install

## node

[Install nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-and-updating) with this tutorial, then run `nvm install --lts`. lts version of node is for general purpose to reduce headache.

## docker

Try [this tutorial](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).
