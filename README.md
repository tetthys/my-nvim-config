# my-nvim-config

I was strongly influenced by [this course by typecraft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHTeCSVAFNY&list=PLsz00TDipIffreIaUNk64KxTIkQaGguqn). If you feel like you've forgotten something, check out this course again. It's a great foundation.

# How to install neovim?

I prefer neovim appimage. It's easy to install. Read [this](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/INSTALL.md) then find the 'AppImage ("universal" Linux package)' section. Then add environment variable `nvim`. If you get confused, refer to [this answer by ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/share/670f958b-2fd4-8000-8cb1-741f022d13f4)
