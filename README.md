I was strongly influenced by [this course by typecraft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHTeCSVAFNY&list=PLsz00TDipIffreIaUNk64KxTIkQaGguqn). If you feel like you've forgotten something, check out this course again. It's a great foundation.

# How to install neovim?

I prefer neovim appimage. It's easy to install. Read [this](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/INSTALL.md) then find the 'AppImage ("universal" Linux package)' section. Then add environment variable `nvim`.

# Must-Have softwares to develope with

# How to install

## node

[Install nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-and-updating) with this tutorial, then run `nvm install --lts`. lts version of node is for general purpose to reduce headache.

## docker

Try [this tutorial](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).
